    "What is Multiprocessing?\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to execute multiple processes concurrently. Each process runs independently with its own memory space. This is different from multithreading, where multiple threads share the same memory space within a single process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it Useful?\n",
    "Overcomes the GIL: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the parallelism of threads in CPython. Multiprocessing circumvents this by creating separate processes, each with its own GIL.\n",
    "Leverages multiple cores: It effectively utilizes multi-core processors, allowing tasks to be distributed across different cores for improved performance.\n",
    "Handles CPU-bound tasks: Ideal for computationally intensive tasks that can benefit from parallel execution.\n",
    "Isolation: Processes have independent memory spaces, reducing the risk of data corruption and race conditions."
