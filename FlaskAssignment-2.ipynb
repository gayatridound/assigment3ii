    "GET and POST are two fundamental HTTP methods used to transfer data between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. While both methods achieve this, they differ significantly in how they handle data and their implications.\n",

    "Purpose: Retrieves data from a specified resource.\n",
    "Data transmission: Appends parameters to the URL as a query string. For example: \n",
    "Visibility: Data is visible in the URL and browser history.\n",
    "Security: Less secure as sensitive data could be exposed.\n",
    "Limitations: Limited data size due to URL length restrictions.\n",

    "POST Method\n",
    "Purpose: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.\n",
    "Data transmission: Sends data in the request body, hidden from the URL.\n",
    "Visibility: Data is not visible in the URL or browser history.\n",
    "Security: More secure as sensitive data is protected.\n",
    "Limitations: No size limitations for data.\n",
