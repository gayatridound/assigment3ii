    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes and objects are fundamental concepts that model the real world. Here's a breakdown of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of a particular kind of object.\n",
    "It acts as a reusable specification for creating objects.\n",
    "A class itself doesn't hold any data or implement any functionality; it just defines the structure.\n",
    "Object:\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity that has attributes (data) with specific values and methods (functions) that operate on that data.\n",
    "When you create an object from a class, you're essentially creating a copy of the class template with its own unique set of data values.\n",
    "Objects can interact with each other by calling each other's methods.\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a class as a cookie cutter used to make cookies. The cookie cutter (class) defines the shape and basic properties of the cookie (object). You can use the cookie cutter (class) to create many individual cookies (objects) with the same shape, but each cookie might have different ingredients or decorations (attributes) that make it unique."

    "he four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation refers to bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data together within a single unit (class).\n",
    "It promotes data hiding by restricting direct access to attributes and controlling how data is manipulated within the class.\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to create new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (superclasses).\n",
    "This promotes code reusability and enables the creation of class hierarchies with specialized functionalities.\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes (but potentially sharing a common ancestor) to respond differently to the same method call.\n",
    "This is achieved through techniques like method overriding and duck typing.\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on providing a simplified interface to hide the underlying implementation details.\n",
    "It allows users to interact with objects without worrying about the complexities of how they work internally."
