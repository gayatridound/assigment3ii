    "What is Multithreading?\n",
    "Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads of execution exist within a single process. These threads share the same memory space, which can improve performance in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Multithreading?\n",
    "Improved performance: Can speed up tasks that involve I/O operations (like network requests or file I/O) by allowing other threads to run while waiting for these operations to complete.\n",
    "Better responsiveness: Can make applications feel more responsive by handling multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
    "Simplified programming: Can sometimes simplify code structure by breaking down tasks into smaller, independent threads.\n",
    "Module for Handling Threads\n",
    "The threading module is the primary module used for multithreading in Python. It provides classes and functions for creating, starting, and managing threads."

    "Deadlocks\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource. This creates a circular dependency where no thread can proceed, resulting in a standstill.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "Race Conditions\n",
    "A race condition happens when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, and the outcome depends on the unpredictable order of execution. This can lead to inconsistent results and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two threads are incrementing a shared counter variable.\n",
    "Both threads read the current value of the counter.\n",
    "Both threads increment the value in their local copy.\n",
    "Both threads write the incremented value back to the shared counter.\n",
    "The final value of the counter might not be the expected sum of the increments due to the unpredictable order of writes.\n",
    "Prevention:\n",
    "To avoid deadlocks and race conditions, it's crucial to use proper synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and condition variables. Careful design and testing are also essential."
