    "Exceptions in Python\n",
    "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. It disrupts the normal flow of the program and, if not handled, can cause the program to terminate abruptly. Exceptions are raised when unexpected conditions arise, such as attempting to divide by zero, accessing an index out of bounds, or opening a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions arise when the code is syntactically correct but encounters an issue during runtime. They can be anticipated and handled gracefully using try-except blocks to prevent program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are fundamental mistakes in the code structure that prevent the program from even running. These errors must be corrected before the program can execute."
