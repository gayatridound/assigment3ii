    "A database is a structured collection of data that is electronically stored and organized in a way that allows for easy access, retrieval, and manipulation. It's essentially a digital filing system that efficiently manages large amounts of information.

    "Use a structured query language (SQL) to define and manipulate data.\n",
    "Data is organized in tables with rows and columns, forming a relational structure where tables can be linked based on shared attributes.\n",
    "Ideal for storing and retrieving well-defined, organized data with predictable relationships between entities.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database.\n",
    "Non-relational Databases (NoSQL Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not rely on a strict schema (data structure) like SQL databases.\n",
    "Offer more flexibility in storing different data types and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data more efficiently.\n",
