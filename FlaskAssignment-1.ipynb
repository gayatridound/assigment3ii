    "Flask is a lightweight, flexible Python web framework. It's classified as a \"microframework\" because it doesn't come with many built-in features like ORM or form validation. This simplicity makes it highly customizable and efficient for building small to medium-sized web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask offers great flexibility, allowing developers to choose their own tools and libraries for database interaction, form validation, and other functionalities.\n",
    "Simplicity: Its core is minimal, making it easy to learn and understand.\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask has a small footprint, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.\n",
    "Performance: Due to its simplicity, Flask applications tend to be performant.\n",
    "Scalability: While it starts small, Flask can be scaled to handle complex applications by adding extensions and libraries.\n",
    "Large Community: A vibrant community provides extensive support and resources.\n",
    "Pythonic: Flask adheres to Python's philosophy, making it natural for Python developers to use.\n",
    "Rapid Development: Its simplicity and flexibility contribute to faster development cycles."

    "App Routing in Flask\n",
    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to specific Python functions (called view functions) that handle incoming requests and generate responses. It's essentially defining the structure of your web application and how different parts of it should respond to user interactions.\n",

    "Organization: Clearly defines the structure of your application and how different URLs relate to specific functionalities.\n",
    "User Experience: Allows you to create meaningful and user-friendly URLs that reflect the content of the page.\n",
    "Modularity: Encourages code reusability and maintainability by separating different parts of the application into distinct functions.\n",
    "Flexibility: Provides control over how your application responds to different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).\n",
